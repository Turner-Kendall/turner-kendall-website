I had an idea to create a minimal Vue3 theme or template based
on The Golden Ratio, the Fibonacci sequence, and other 
"sacred geometry".  Full disclosure I was inspired by Disney's [*Donald in Mathmagic Land"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl6JDv4ZG7U)

The minimal bit is achieved largely with pico.css 

Feel free to use it if you need to spin up a Vue site quickly and cleanly.

`npm run dev`
`npm run build`

Pico has it's own modal; so to save a little bandwidth you could remove SweetAlert2, but it's awesome so I would keep it were I you.  I have also include the vue use core and vue3-burger-menu.
