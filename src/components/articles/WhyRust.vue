        ðŸ¦€ Rust is trendy for several (compelling) reasons. Here are my top reasons for investing my time learning it.
      </p>
    </header>

    <ul class="listicle">
      <li>Memory Safety: Rust addresses memory-related issues that languages like C and C++ have struggled with. It
        ensures better memory safety by catching memory errors at compile time, reducing the risk of runtime 
        crashes and security vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Zero-Cost Abstraction: Rust allows high-level abstractions without sacrificing performance. You can write
        expressive code without worrying about overhead, thanks to Rust's efficient compilation
      </li>
      <li> Control Over Low-Level Details: Rust gives developers the choice of managing memory on the stack or heap. It
        determines memory cleanup at compile time, ensuring efficient resource usage
      </li>
      <li> Growing Ecosystem: Rust's ecosystem is expanding rapidly. It's used in various domains, from systems
        programming to web development (e.g., Dropbox, Firefox) and even embedded systems.
      </li>
      <li> Type Safety: Rust's static type system catches errors early, promoting long-term maintainability. Unlike some
        statically-typed languages, Rust avoids null-related issues by using an optional type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scalability and Concurrency: Rust is suitable for building heavy applications, including IoT projects. Its
        logical and functional syntax facilitates low-level programming.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <p> Rust combines the speed of low-level languages with the safety of high-level languages making it an excellent
        choice for modern software development and not surprisingly the job market for Rust developers is booming ðŸ˜¼</p>
